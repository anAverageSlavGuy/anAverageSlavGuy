Hi, I’m a software developer who is passionate about creating simply open-source codes, to help other people in their daily work.
<br>
I'm minimalist, lover of clean code and :fries:. 
<br>
I speak 3 languages: Italian, Russian and English.

The quote that I really like is: 
<i><b>"Simplicity is Complicated"</b></i> by Rob Pike
